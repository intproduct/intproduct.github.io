# The End of the Feast? High-Energy Physics at a Crossroads
## The Origins
**Around** the 1930s and 1940s, physics below the atomic scale—generally known as subatomic or particle physics—entered a period of vigorous development, benefiting from the near completion of quantum mechanics' foundational framework and rapid advancements in engineering. Since the 1930s, research into leptons like electrons and muons, as well as the atomic nucleus, had steadily grown. This marked the origin of modern high-energy experimental physics.

**In** these early decades, subatomic experiments focused primarily on two areas: electron excitation within atoms (a field now considered part of condensed matter, or low-energy, physics) and particles found in cosmic rays. The latter was the true genesis of high-energy physics. Cosmic rays were a suitable subject of study simply because the energy scale of these naturally occurring particles was sufficiently high.

**However**, these particles decay rapidly upon entering Earth's environment. Most are lost to atmospheric absorption, while a few, like muons, penetrate the atmosphere but have an extremely short lifespan (often less than $10^{-8}$ seconds). This necessitated cosmic-ray observatories at extremely high altitudes to mitigate the attrition. This "relying on nature's bounty" approach yielded foundational discoveries. In 1932, Carl Anderson observed the positron ($e^+$) in a cloud chamber, the first confirmation of antimatter. This was followed in 1937 by the discovery of the muon ($\mu$), a particle so unexpected it prompted I. I. Rabi's famous quip, "Who ordered that?" In 1947, Cecil Powell’s team, using nuclear emulsions on mountainsides, finally found the pi meson (\pi), the particle Hideki Yukawa had predicted as the mediator of the strong nuclear force.
## The Golden Age
**Entering** the 1950s and 60s, quantum field theory and the Standard Model of particle physics began to develop rapidly, making the experimental demand for high-energy particles even more urgent. On a technical level, humanity resolved to escape the fate of "relying on nature's bounty" and instead to "manufacture our own results." Thus, accelerator physics was born.

**The** development of accelerators and their detection technologies propelled immense progress, from fundamental physics to engineering. On the physics front, colliders capable of reaching the GeV energy scale allowed countless high-energy particles (bound states) to be artificially prepared and measured. This provided the experimental basis for establishing and clarifying the particle model of interactions. This era became a systematic unpeeling of the Standard Model:

 * 1950s: The Bevatron ($\sim 6 GeV$) in Berkeley discovered the antiproton (1955), confirming matter-antimatter symmetry and opening the "particle zoo."
 
 * 1960s-70s: Deep inelastic scattering experiments at SLAC provided the first direct evidence for quarks inside protons. This was followed by the "November Revolution" (1974), where the J/\psi particle was co-discovered at BNL and SLAC, confirming the existence of the charm quark.
 
 * 1980s: At CERN, the SPS collider was used to discover the W and Z bosons (1983), providing definitive proof of the electroweak unified theory.
 
 * 1990s-2000s: Fermilab’s Tevatron discovered the final and heaviest quark, the top quark (1995), while the LEP collider at CERN precisely determined that there are only three generations of light neutrinos.

**On** an engineering level, the miniaturization and civilian application of related experimental technologies spawned radiation light sources, laser technology, semiconductor technology, and even the World Wide Web itself (developed at CERN). From a scientific development perspective, the construction and operation of large particle colliders required enormous research teams, pushing high-energy experimental physics toward a model of large-scale, multinational collaboration. This "Golden Age" reached its zenith in 2013 with the validation of the Higgs boson at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
## The Party is Over?
**Today**, the topic that concerns both high-energy theorists and experimentalists is "physics beyond the Standard Model." This implies the need for even larger colliders/accelerators, at the TeV scale or higher.

**However**, the construction of such "mega-projects" is clearly beyond the power of academia alone, and often exceeds the capacity of many individual nations. It requires countries or regions with strong comprehensive national power (at least economically) to invest vast funds and resources. Consequently, the demands of high-energy scientists have met with skepticism from all sides: their physicist colleagues in other fields, peers in the broader scientific community, policymakers, and taxpayers.

**The** most painful precedent was the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) in the United States. Planned in the 1980s with a 40 TeV energy goal, its budget ballooned from $\4.4 billion$ to over $\11 billion$. In 1993, after $\2 billion$ had been spent and 20 km of tunnel dug, the U.S. Congress canceled the project, effectively ceding leadership in the "energy frontier" to Europe.

**Today**, similar debates rage. Europe’s Future Circular Collider (FCC), Japan’s International Linear Collider (ILC), and China’s Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC/SepC) have all faced intense questioning in their respective regions. The ILC, for instance, has stalled due to Japan's hesitation over its massive cost and the lack of firm financial commitments from international partners.

**In** China, a representative opposing voice for the CEPC came from the recently deceased, renowned physicist C. N. Yang. He shared the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics with T. D. Lee for discovering parity non-conversation in weak interactions and is also famed for co-developing the Yang-Mills theory, the framework for the Standard Model. Yang was a staunch opponent of building new large colliders. During an exchange with other high-energy physicists, he famously remarked, "The party is over," implying that the era of high-energy physics reliant on large colliders had lost its promise. In 2012, he publicly published articles opposing the plan, and many believe his articles were instrumental in preventing the project from being included in China's national economic development plans for the subsequent decade.

**Within** China, some high-energy physicists and supporters criticize his advice as "uninformed of the full facts" or "unprofessional." Conversely, Yang's supporters argue that the economic demands are too great and ill-timed, or that the return on investment is not proportional. Dr. Wang Yifang, the former director of China's Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) [note: now led by Dr. Cao Jun], is a steadfast supporter of the large collider and has worked for years to promote it. Consequently, IHEP is often seen by researchers in China as the project's "main driving force," playing the role of its vanguard.III. The Party is Over?

## Where to Go From Here?
**Despite** the intense skepticism surrounding large colliders, it does not mean high-energy experimental researchers are facing unemployment.

**First**, general-purpose colliders at specific energy scales and other large scientific facilities are still being developed. China is actively preparing the "Super Tau-Charm Facility" (STCF) and the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO). These projects, with limited scale and budgets, are targeted at precisely studying specific particle properties. Europe also continues to maintain and upgrade CERN's accelerators.

**Second**, is high-energy research without accelerators viable? Today, after nearly 80 years of particle physics, humanity is once again turning its gaze to the sky. From "relying on nature's bounty" to "manufacturing our own," and now back again, physicists are equipped with far more advanced techniques.

 * In China, researchers lead the LHAASO (Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory), which in 2021 announced the discovery of photons exceeding 1.4 PeV ($10^{15} \text{eV}$), proving the existence of "PeVatrons," or natural particle accelerators, within our galaxy. China also operates the DAMPE ("Wukong") satellite, which detected an intriguing potential spectral break in cosmic-ray electrons around 0.9 TeV.
 
 * In the Antarctic, the U.S.-led IceCube observatory has opened the window to neutrino astronomy, famously tracing a high-energy neutrino back to a flaring blazar in 2017.
 
 * In Japan, the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment is under construction. As a successor to the Nobel-winning Super-Kamiokande, its primary goal is to search for CP violation in neutrinos, a clue to why our universe is made of matter and not antimatter.
 
 * Dr. C. C. Ting, who discovered the J/\psi particle, leads the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) on the International Space Station.

**These** high-altitude or space-based detectors, observing particles that have not been scattered by Earth's atmosphere, can reach energy levels far exceeding those of terrestrial accelerators. Some researchers believe that with advances in space detection technology and the bottlenecks facing accelerators, high-energy physics may ultimately have to return to the path of "relying on nature's bounty."
## Outlook
**What** the future holds remains unknown. Recently, C. N. Yang passed away at the age of 103. The very next day [Note: The report was submitted to arXiv on Oct 6, 2025, and publicly announced by IHEP on Oct 20, 2025, two days after Yang's passing on Oct 18], the final technical design report (TDR) for the CEPC was uploaded to the arXiv preprint server, just as China begins to formulate its next five-year plan. This coincidence has once again stirred heated debate among China's researchers and enthusiasts, just as Yang's public opposition did years ago.

**Today**, facing global economic pressures but also armed with a more diverse set of research methods and hopes, the greatest test for the supporters of accelerators and colliders will be whether they can present an argument compelling enough to convince the world.IV. Where to Go From Here?
